Visual Distraction by Attractive Faces in a Search Task
========

Summary
-------

.. engl

We used eye tracking and reaction time recordings to explore the effect of attractive faces on a search task.
The attractiveness of face stimuli was rated per-participant via a thrice repeated visual analogue scale measurement.
The reaction time measurements were analized both via significance tests applied to discrete categories and via correlation analysis. 
We report a significant delay in reaction times for the detection of targets flanked by attractive faces and a converse effects for targets flanked by unattractive faces.
Eye tracking data analysis shows a predilection of gaze location towards the side of the screen containing less attractive faces.
